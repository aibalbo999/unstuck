# Operator Guide

## Start The App

Use the macOS launcher for normal local operation:

```bash
./start_mac.command
```

For terminal-only checks:

```bash
scripts/check_runtime.py --strict
scripts/demo_report.sh
```

## Daily Workflow

1. Open the analysis tab.
2. Enter a ticker such as `2308.TW`.
3. Pick mode A, mode B, or continuous A+B.
4. Read the preview first, then open the full report when needed.
5. Use report compare or rerun only when the conclusion or data freshness says the report is stale.

## Freshness Rules

- `data_trust` tells you whether the data snapshot itself is fresh, partial, stale, or errored.
- `decision_freshness.status = current` means the investment conclusion was generated from the current snapshot.
- `decision_freshness.status = needs_rerun` means the snapshot was refreshed after the HTML/Markdown conclusion was written. Treat the old conclusion as historical until rerun finishes.
- Watchlist items use the same signal. Items marked `需重跑` are sorted first so the operator can rerun the stale conclusion before reviewing lower-priority names.

## Maintenance

Maintenance actions live under the `報告與維運` tab. HTTP cleanup endpoints are dry-run by default; UI buttons send `write=true` only after the operator intentionally clicks the action.

Use CLI maintenance for inspectable local cleanup:

```bash
scripts/maintenance.sh storage-summary
scripts/maintenance.sh cleanup-report-index --write
scripts/maintenance.sh cleanup-analysis-history --write
```

## Safety

Mutation endpoints require `X-Mutation-Token`. The browser UI receives a same-origin runtime token automatically. Direct API clients should call `/api/client-config` first or set `MUTATION_API_TOKEN` and send that value in `X-Mutation-Token`.
